# * TODO: create algorithm on coming to altitude and moving drone to center image
# 1. connect
# 2. launch and save initial gps
# 3. gain input on any 'white' image on ground
# 4. TEST algorithm to determine distance of movement depending on distance from center of camera on screen
# -- something haivng to do with calculating and translating vector?
# 5. move drone to that specified local coordinate
# 6. run TEST algorithm to double check center alignment of image
# 7. repeat TEST movement until centered
# 8. get gps coordinates
# 9. run opencv to determine image type
# 10. go back to initial gps and land
